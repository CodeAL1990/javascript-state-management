# javascript-state-management

Boilerplate for canvas
Add dogImage img tag and h1 tag with id loading and text
Add type module to script(allows you to split code into separate files and use import/export keywords to connect with the data)
The above will be useful when connecting with different js files(as you can see with the multiple js files in this project)
